## Introduction

Adversarial robustness remains a significant challenge in deploying deep neural networks for real-world applications. While adversarial training is widely acknowledged as a promising defense strategy, most existing studies primarily focus on balanced datasets, neglecting the fact that real-world data often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, which introduces substantial challenges to robustness. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of adversarial training in the context of long-tailed distributions and identify the limitations of the current state-of-the-art method, AT-BSL, in achieving robust performance under such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework, TAET, which incorporates an initial stabilization phase followed by a stratified, equalization adversarial training phase. Furthermore, prior work on long-tailed robustness has largely overlooked a crucial evaluation metric—balanced accuracy. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of balanced robustness, a comprehensive metric that measures robustness specifically under long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing advanced defenses, yielding significant improvements in both memory and computational efficiency. We believe this work represents a substantial step forward in tackling robustness challenges in real-world applications.

## Data and Code Description

We base our work on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which we process using `create_cifar10-lt.ipynb` to generate long-tailed distributions with varying imbalance ratios (IR). This processing transforms the original dataset from `cifar-10-batches-py/` into four distinct long-tailed datasets:

- `cifar10lt_10/` - CIFAR-10 with IR of 10
- `cifar10lt_20/` - CIFAR-10 with IR of 20
- `cifar10lt_50/` - CIFAR-10 with IR of 50
- `cifar10lt_100/` - CIFAR-10 with IR of 100

Our codebase is organized into two main parts:
1. `code/AT-BSL/` - Contains the implementation of the baseline AT-BSL method
2. `code/TAET/` - Contains our proposed TAET method implementation

By default, our example code uses the `cifar10lt_10` dataset (IR of 10). You can modify the dataset path to evaluate performance on other imbalance ratios.

Additionally, we provide a standalone implementation of Hierarchical Adversarial Robustness Loss in `HARL.py` and include a simple demonstration of our TAET method in `TAET_demo.ipynb`.
